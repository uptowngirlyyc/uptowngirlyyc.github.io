 <!-- LASER HAIR REMOVAL -->

   <div class="col-sm-2">

     <div class="col-sm-8">
       <p>Laser hair removal is a medical procedure that uses a concentrated beam of light (laser) to remove unwanted hair.
       Although laser hair removal effectively delays hair growth for long periods, it usually doesn't result in permanent hair removal. 
Multiple laser hair removal treatments are needed for initial hair removal, and maintenance treatments might be needed as well. 
Laser hair removal is most effective for people who have light skin and dark hair.</p>

     <div class="col-sm-4">
       <h3>HOW DOES LASER WORK? </h3>
        <p> During laser hair removal, a laser emits a light that is absorbed by the pigment (melanin) in the hair. 
        The light energy is converted to heat, which damages the tube-shaped sacs within the skin (hair follicles) that produce hairs. 
        This damage inhibits or delays future hair growth.

      <h3>WHAT IS THE RESTRICTION? </h3>
      <p>Like all surgical and cosmetic practices, the effects of plasma treatment are not permanent as nothing can stop further ageing.
        But the results should last you a few years depending on the area treated, race and genetics , as well as  smoking, alcohol consumption, and prolonged sun exposure. 
        The effects of treatment will be immediately noticeable, but the best results will show after 4 - 8 weeks.  </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4"> 
        <h3>REQUIRED TREATMENT TIMES </h3>
      <p>It will depend on the condition being treated, skin  laxity, hair type, the desired degree of the laser and the individual’s response to the treatment. 
        Most clients see results instantly and this continues to improve over the following 2-4 weeks. Further treatments can be carried out to get better results, 
        although it is uncommon to require more than twelve treatments. Appointments must be spaced out 3-4 weeks. </p>

    Avoid UV exposure 7 days prior to your treatment.
    Clients who are sunburned or tanned must wait 2 weeks before being treated to avoid additional  skin damage.
    Avoid sunless tanning products 7 days prior to your treatment. It is recommended that you  exfoliate the area to remove any residual color.
    If applicable, apply numbing cream 30 to 40 minutes prior to your treatment. All products must be completely removed prior to treatment.
    Clients should come to appointments with clean skin in the area to be treated. All clients who are treating any part of their face or neck will be required to cleanse their entire face in the clinic.
    Avoid chemical peels and other laser procedures in the area to be treated for 2 weeks prior and  two weeks after your laser treatment.
    Avoid all alpha hydroxy and beta hydroxyl products (AHA/BHA), hydroquinone,  retinols/retinoid, Tazorac, and Differin for 7 days before treatment.

    Clients must stop waxing, tweezing and chemical epilation 3 weeks prior to treatment.
    If you are prone to cold sores, it is highly recommended to take an anti-viral medication (such as Valtrex) prior to your treatment. Clients with active cold sores will not be treated.

If you become ill and begin taking an antibiotic, you will need to be off the medication for 7 days before laser treatment.

    If blisters occur, do not puncture. If skin is broken, apply an antibiotic ointment until healed.
    Tylenol is recommended for post-treatment discomfort.
    Over the counter medication is recommended for post treatment discomfort. You may also apply cool towels, ice packs or aloe vera to alleviate discomfort due to heat.
    Avoid using seat warmers immediately after treatment. 
    Avoid any additional laser treatments or chemical procedures on the treated area for at least 2  weeks post-treatment or until healing has occurred.
    Using a broad spectrum UVA/UVB SPF 30 or higher is critical when receiving laser treatments and  is recommended ongoing for maintenance.
    If you experience any side effects, such as hypo- or hyper-pigmentation, prolonged redness or  swelling, a histamine reaction, or blistering, call or come in for instructions on treatment.
    To achieve the best results, complete the full treatment schedule at the intervals recommended  by your technician.
