     <div class="col-sm-8">
       <p>The Plasma Pro Skin Tightening method is an increasingly popular treatment as it requires no cutting of the skin. 
         It is a safe treatment due to its non-invasive nature.
        This means clients can resume their daily lives a lot sooner as stitches are not required.</p>
      <p> Plasma Pro Skin Tightening is a relatively new innovation in the beauty industry in North America but has been used
        for a number of years in Europe. The extremely accurate device works by utilizing the voltage in the air between its tip
        and the skin, to form a plasma charge. An electrical arc is created and instantly shrinks the targeted skin.  
        The tissue retraction and tightening gives results that are comparable to invasive surgery.</p>

       <h3>TREATMENT AREAS </h3>
        <p> Our service focuses on a skin care method called Plasma Pro Skin Tightening - using plasma to eliminate excess skin.
        This treatment is available for Eye lift, Skin tag removal, Tummy tightening, and Stretch mark repair without any surgery,
        scalpel, stitches or bandages and minimal downtime. A minimally invasive procedure with much lower risk and more affordable then actual surgery.

      <h3>HOW LONG DOES IT LAST? </h3>
      <p>Like all surgical and cosmetic practices, the effects of plasma treatment are not permanent as nothing can stop further ageing.
        But the results should last you a few years depending on the area treated, race and genetics , as well as  smoking, alcohol consumption, and prolonged sun exposure. 
        The effects of treatment will be immediately noticeable, but the best results will show after 4 - 8 weeks.  </p>

        <h3>HOW MANY TREATMENTS ARE REQUIRED? </h3>
      <p>It will depend on the condition being treated, skin  laxity, the desired degree of correction and the individual’s response to the treatment. 
        Most clients see results instantly and this continues to improve over the following 2-4 weeks. Further treatments can be carried out to get better results, 
        although it is uncommon to require more than two treatments. Appointments must be spaced out 6-8 weeks. </p>

      <h3>SIDE EFFECTS AND RISKS</h3>
      <p> There are some minor side effects that may occur the first two weeks after the treatment.
There will be small brown/ pinky marks that look like minor scabbing. These are carbon crusts which last about a week then disappear. 
Some swelling will be seen (especially in cases of eyelid treatment) a few days.  Swelling in the eye area is to be expected for a few days following an upper eyelid treatment. 
To avoid any more serious side effects such as hyperpigmentation, follow the aftercare recommendations given to you by your technician.

      <h3>CAUTIONARY ADVICE</h3>
        <p>Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not undergo Plasma Pro Skin Tightening. 
          This treatment is also not advised for those with very dark skin because there is a higher risk of hyperpigmentation (dark spots) 
          or hypopigmentation (light spots) following the treatment, 
          especially if the skin is disrupted by abrasion or picking during the resting period after the treatment. </p>
